This is where I'll be posting all the steps taken.

trying to run a base react project.

I just had to setup eslint as well, 
settings:- javascript import module, react project, uses typescript

had to install typescript globally

I had to enable emmet for javascript in react especially since we're basically writing html in js


### tailwindcss v3.0
`npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss autoprefixer`
we saved those as dev dependencies

now we have to init using `npx`
`npx tailwindcss init`
